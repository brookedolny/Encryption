# Encryption
A library of my own implementations of various forms of encryption and crypto resources.

Currently have a working implementation of the Advanced Encryption Standard, with two Modes of Operation: CBC and ECB,
as well as the SHA2 suite of cryptographic hashes. 

Each folder has it's own README with more information about the contents
