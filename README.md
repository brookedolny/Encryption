# Encryption
An in-progress implementation of the Advanced Encryption Standard. This is my own implementation written based on the publication from NIST. This implementation is not for official use.

##Advanced Encryption Standard
The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is a block cipher that uses 128, 192, or 256 bit keys (referenced as AES-128, AES-192, and AES-256), and takes an input of a 128-bit block.
